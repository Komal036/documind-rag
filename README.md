## ✨ Features

- **Authentication** — JWT-based signup/login, bcrypt password hashing. All document, chat, and query data is scoped per user.
- **Document Ingestion** — PDF, TXT, DOCX, MD (PyMuPDF + pdfplumber fallback)
- **Chunking** — RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter (512 chars, 50 overlap)
- **Two-Stage Retrieval** — `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` bi-encoder for candidate retrieval, `ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` cross-encoder for re-ranking
- **Vector Store** — PostgreSQL + `pgvector`, with per-user scoped similarity search (ChromaDB also supported as a swappable local-dev backend)
- **Answer Generation** — Groq (`llama-3.3-70b-versatile`) via an OpenAI/Groq/Mistral-pluggable provider layer, with inline `[N]` citations
- **Multi-Turn Chat Memory** — Redis-backed conversation history per chat session (TTL-based), dual-written to PostgreSQL for a durable message log
- **Self-RAG (Corrective RAG)** — an opt-in v2 retrieval mode built with LangGraph: retrieval confidence is scored using the reranker's own top score; if confidence is low, the query is automatically reformulated and retried (hard-capped at 2 retries to prevent infinite loops). If confidence never improves, the system explicitly declines to answer rather than guessing.
- **REST API** — FastAPI with OpenAPI docs
- **Frontend** — React + Vite + Tailwind CSS: login/signup, chat with citations and session memory, document upload/management, live health and stats

## 🏗 Architecture

```
Document → Load → Chunk → Embed → Store (pgvector)
Query    → Embed → Retrieve (bi-encoder) → Re-rank (cross-encoder) → Generate (LLM) → Cited answer
                                                        │
                                     [Self-RAG v2] confidence check → reformulate → retry (max 2x)
```

**Data model (PostgreSQL, 6 tables):** `User`, `Document`, `Embedding`, `ChatSession`, `Message`, `QueryLog` — managed via SQLAlchemy + Alembic migrations.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Backend setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Komal036/documind-rag.git
cd documind-rag

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in: DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET_KEY, REDIS_HOST, GROQ_API_KEY (or your chosen LLM provider key)
```

### 3. Database

Requires PostgreSQL with the `pgvector` extension enabled, and Redis (or Redis-compatible, e.g. Memurai on Windows) running locally.

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### 4. Run the backend

```bash
uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

API docs: **http://localhost:8000/docs**

### 5. Run the frontend

```bash
cd frontend/react_app
npm install
npm run dev
```

UI: **http://localhost:5173**

### Example

```bash
# Sign up
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "you@example.com", "password": "yourpassword", "full_name": "Your Name"}'

# Ingest (replace TOKEN with the access_token from signup/login)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ingest \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@data/samples/sample_hr_policy.txt"

# Query

  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is the remote work policy?"}'

## 📊 Evaluation

A RAGAS evaluation baseline was run against an 8-question set grounded in the sample HR policy document (`scripts/evaluate_ragas.py`, `data/eval/hr_policy_qa.json`).

**v1 (single-pass retrieval) vs. Self-RAG (v2), same question set, same judge model:**

| Metric | v1 | Self-RAG (v2) | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Faithfulness | 1.000 | 1.000 | No change (v1 was already at the ceiling on this set) |
| Answer Relevancy | 0.912 | 0.965 | +0.053 |
| Avg. retries per question | — | 0.50 | Half of questions triggered at least one query reformulation |

Both scores exclude one deliberately out-of-scope question (asking about a policy not present in the documents), since a correct refusal cannot be meaningfully scored by the AnswerRelevancy metric.

**Notes on methodology, stated plainly rather than glossed over:**
- Faithfulness could not improve in this comparison because v1 was already at a perfect 1.000 on this small, 8-question set — there was no room to show a gain. A larger, harder evaluation set would be needed to properly stress-test faithfulness.
- LLM-judge metrics have real run-to-run and judge-model-to-judge-model variance. This comparison controlled for that by using the identical judge model for both runs; an earlier exploratory run using a different judge model produced meaningfully different per-question scores, which is expected and is noted here rather than hidden.
- The Self-RAG relevancy improvement (+0.053) is a real, controlled result. It has not been validated on a larger or more diverse question set.

This baseline was also used to diagnose and fix a real issue: the system was occasionally including related-but-unasked-for information from the same retrieved chunk, which was addressed with a targeted system prompt constraint.
